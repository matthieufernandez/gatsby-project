**Gestion Horizon** is a full-stack CRM application built entirely in React.

It allows landlords and tennants to communicate with each other through a mailing system and for the management of rent payments through the Stripe API. Payments can be processed through credit or debit card, and tennants can signal issues with their rental unit to their landlords. Data is stored in Firebase's database system and automatic emails are handled by EmailJS.
