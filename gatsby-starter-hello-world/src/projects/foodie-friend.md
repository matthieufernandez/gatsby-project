**Foodie Friend** is a full-stack web application that allows users to find recipes based on the ingredients available in their virtual fridge.

Users create and authenticate an account using 0Auth, and then are connected to the spoonacular API, where they are able to find ingredients and add them to a virtual fridge. They are then able to search for recipes based on these ingredients (if they choose), and then save those recipes to their recipe books.

Fridge and recipe books, as well as authenticated account details are saved to a mongoDB database for file permanence.
