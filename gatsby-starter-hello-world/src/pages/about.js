          Hi, I'm Matt and I'm a nascent web developer! Ever since I was a young
          boy I've loved computers and I'm hoping to take my skills to the next
          level by applying them to web development. This is the second time
          I've changed careers, after working as a Customer Success Manager and
          a teacher of both French and English. I love movies, literature, and
          philosophy, but none more than I love people. As such, I've learned
          strong leadership and team-building skills over the years, and I love
          to keep everyone around me happy and engaged. If that sounds like
          someone you'd want on your team, don't hesitate to reach out to me;
          I'd love to hear from you.
